Hi all,

I just pushed grades on Scoryst for HW1. If you dont see your scores for something you submitted on time, or have any other issues, please start a private Piazza post, and well get it worked out.

You will see your raw scores regardless of whether you submitted problems early or not. We will evaluate the XC in our gradebook.
