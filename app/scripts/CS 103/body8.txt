If you have a midterm regrade request, please email nayaknestanford.edu, mentioning the question number and the reason why you believe that the score awarded was incorrect.

As we have access to scans of the midterms, we do not need to see the paper copies.

Please submit all midterm regrade requests with a week of the midterms being returned - by February 18th.
