Some students are approaching problem 3 like this:
1. Figure out the answer to the problem, somehow.
2. Try to write a logical formula that captures the results.

That is not the intended approach. The intended approach is:
1. Translate the statement of the problem to logic, without thinking about what the result will be.
2.  Build a truth table and read off the answer.
3.  Check your answer by thinking about the problem in other ways.

The goal is to get a little practice translating a problem to logic -- not translating the SOLUTION to logic -- and to automate part of the solution to the problem.
