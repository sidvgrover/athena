Once you've completed this assignment, you'll have a full working compiler for Decaf.

This assignment is broken into two portions - a checkpoint assignment due on Monday, July 30 at 11:59PM (hard deadline), and the main assignment, which is due on Monday, August 6 at 11:59PM.

We'll meet in the normal room (Thornton 102). The exam covers the material up to and including Earley parsing, with an emphasis on scanning, LL, and LR parsing. The exam is open-book, open-note, open-computer, but closed-network, meaning that you can have the slides and other notes available during the exam. You just can't go Googling the answers. \n \n There is a practice exam available, which is the exam that was given last summer quarter. The structure and content of this exam is similar to that of the upcoming exam. \n \n If you are taking this class remotely, you will receive an electronic copy of the exam at around 11:00AM on July 25 and can start taking the exam any time between 11:00AM on July 25 and 11:00AM on July 26.

To use them, you will need to follow these instructions: \n   Download the Windows version of bison. When prompted for an installation directory, do not use the default directory. Instead, install bison to C:\\GnuWin32, not in \"Program Files.\" This is due to a bug in the bison implementation that causes it not to work correctly if it's placed in a directory whose name contains a space.  Download the Windows version of sed and m4. When prompted for an installation directory, do not use the default directory. Instead, install bison to C:\\GnuWin32, not in \"Program Files.\"  Download the Windows pp2 starter project.

It's due on Friday, July 20 at 11:59PM. In this assignment, you will build up the parser for Decaf, and will learn how to use the bison tool in the process.

To do so, you will need an SSH client. On Linux or Mac computers, you can do this from the command-line with ssh. On Windows, you will need to download a SSH client such as PuTTY or SecureCRT (available with your SUNetID here). From there, you will want to connect to either myth.stanford.edu or corn.stanford.edu. You will probably get a warning about a RSA key not matching, which is perfectly fine; these above hostnames will forward you to a free machine on the cluster.
