#to create new record
resource = Resource.new(param1: "param1value", param2:...)
#this is not saved into the database until you call:
resource.save

#new piazza post
post = PiazzaPost.new(title: value, body: value, instructor: value, date: put a ruby date)

#linking things:
#either a:
post.course = course #if you have the variable reference
#same as above just diff syntax:
post.course_id = course.id

#or b:
#if you don't have a variable
course = Course.find_by_name("CS 142")


#clearing the database: run 'rake db:migrate:reset' in the console in the server root folder
